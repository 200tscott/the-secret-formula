# The Secret Formula

In this assignment we'll be exploring the world of forms! Begin by forking and cloning this assignment and creating an `index.html` file, a `styles.css` file, and a `main.js` file.

## Part 1: The alerter

Let's start out simple, in your `index.html` file, create a form that contains a text input and a submit button. From here, use Javascript to make it so that when the submit button is clicked, the page displays the text inside of the text input as a browser alert.

## Part 2: Sandwich builder

Somewhere below your previous form, create a new form. The purpose of this form will be to allow the user to select ingredients that will go in a sandwich. Inside of your form, create at least ten checkbox inputs that correspond to various sandwich ingredients (wheat bread, lettuce, peppers, etc.). Additionally, create a submit button.

Finally, wire up your form using Javascript so that upon clicking the submit button, a browser alert is displayed with a string with all of the ingredients that the user selected by checking the inputs (i.e.: "Your sandwich contains: bread, pesto, tomato, mozzerella, spinach"). To do this, you'll need to build a string, querying each checkbox one at a time. You could use a for-loop to do this but you are not required to do so.

## Part 3: Haircut appointment scheduler

Below your previous form, create another new form. This form will represent a haircut scheduling form which should contain the following inputs:
* a date input for what day the haircut should be scheduled for
* a text input to allow the user to request a specific hair cutter
* one set of two radio inputs that allows the user to select whether they have long or short hair
* a submit button
